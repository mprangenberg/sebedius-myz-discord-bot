mcoriolis-nekatra;6;5;2;2;16;11;4;1;Fight 3|Infiltration 2|Observation 2;**Throat Attack** Nekatra often go for the throat of their enemies. A throat bite has a CRIT value of 1 but can only be performed after the nekatra has spent a fast action to prepare. A successful throat attack also pins the nekatra’s opponent (see Grappling, page 87).\n**Feral Hunger** The nekatra enters a state of blind rage, attacking everything around it. It can perform one additional melee attack per turn, but all attacks suffer a -2 modifier and the beast can no longer defend itself. Entering the feral rage is a normal action in itself.\n**Legion Nekatra** The nekatra has been bionically altered, giving it 10 extra HP, stronger bite attacks (Weapon Damage 4) and mediglands that secrete an m-dose-like substance every two turns. If the nekatra is broken, it can get back up at 3 HP if it passes a `FORCE` test at -1. It can also have one cybernetic implant of the GM’s choosing.;coriolis;{bite:0:1:0:CRIT 2}|{claws:0:2:0:CRIT 3}
mcoriolis-skavara;2;3;3;2;14;5;5;;Fight 1|Manipulation 1|Infiltration 3|Observation 3;**Stench** The skavara have scent glands on their necks, used for marking territories. A scared or cornered skavara can activate these glands in an emergency, letting off a pungent odor that affects mucous membranes and eyes. Enemies within `CLOSE` Range get a -2 modifier to all actions until they get away from the stench. They also have to test `FORCE`, suffering 2 points of stress if they fail.\n**Sniff** Skavara can use their sense of smell to test `MANIPULATION` and determine if someone is hostile or lying. They also get a +2 to `OBSERVATION` if there are scent trails to follow.;coriolis;{claws:0:1:0:CRIT 3}
mcoriolis-ekilibri;1;5;1;3;10;6;4;;Infiltration 3|Observation 3;**Battle Cry** The ekilibri can let out a loud, high shriek that is painful and disorienting at `SHORT` Range. Everyone in the area of effect must test `FORCE`. Failure means 2 points of stress and the loss of one’s next action. Someone with sensitive or enhanced hearing gets a -2 to the roll.\n**Agility** The nimble ekilibri can jump far and high, as well as squeeze into very tight spaces such as ventilation shafts or pipes.\n**Night Vision** Ekilibri have good vision even in darkness and get no negative modifiers for bad lighting.;coriolis;{claws:0:1:0:CRIT 3}
